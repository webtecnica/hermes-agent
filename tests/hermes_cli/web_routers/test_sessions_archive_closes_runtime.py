"""Archiving a session must end its runtime; hiding it must not.

PATCH ``/api/sessions/{id}`` used to flip the ``archived`` column only. The core treats
archive as end-of-life (``_finalize_session``, #105588: the durable row stays resumable
"until the user explicitly closes or archives it"), so leaving the runtime, its
active-session lease and the transcript resident is the seam that orphans a delivery
lease and leaks a ``max_concurrent_sessions`` slot. The route now calls
``_close_session_by_id(sid, end_reason="archived")`` on the explicit archive.

``hidden`` is deliberately NOT a close trigger: the canonical Bot Chat is born hidden
(``tui_gateway/methods_session.py``), so acting on it would tear down a live, intended
session and kill its live delivery.

These tests exercise the REAL route (FastAPI ``manage_router`` via ``TestClient``) against
a REAL ``SessionDB`` and a REAL ``tui_gateway.server`` session registered with a REAL
active-session lease in a real registry file -- no stubs for the path under test. They
fail on the pre-patch route (leg 1 only: leg 2 is what bounds the contract, proving the
close is not a blanket "any PATCH closes the session").
