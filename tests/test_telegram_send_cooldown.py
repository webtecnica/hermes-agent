"""TelegramAdapter per-chat send-cooldown gate.

Cross-cutting rate-limiter for outbound ``send()`` calls. Telegram's
Bot API enforces ~1 msg/sec/chat in private DMs and a global ~30
msg/sec budget across all chats for bots. A single user turn
historically fans out 3-5 sends from independent code paths
(status callbacks, progress bubbles, streaming previews, final
answer) and they were fired in parallel — a burst pattern that
crosses Telegram's threshold and triggers a flood-control penalty
that escalates into multi-thousand-second back-offs.

The fix is a per-chat minimum-gap gate in ``send()`` so the
cumulative send rate stays under the threshold regardless of how
many components fire concurrently. These tests pin the gate's
behaviour:

  - successful sends stamp the cooldown so the next send to the
    same chat waits for ``_send_cooldown_seconds``
  - a different chat has an independent cooldown
  - the wait is bounded by ``_send_cooldown_max_wait`` so a
    7000-second Telegram penalty doesn't stall the chat path
  - a send that arrives just after the cooldown expires goes
    through without an extra delay
